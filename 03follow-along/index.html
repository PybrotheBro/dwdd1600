        <h2>What it Says</h2>
        <p>
            "When in the Course of human events,
            it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political
            bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among
            the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws
            of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of
            mankind requires that they should declare the causes which
            impel them to the separation."

        <h2>Why we are upset</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Here are the reasons in bullet points:

                Taxes without representation**: The British imposed
                taxes like the Stamp Act and Townshend Acts on the colonies without
                giving them a voice in Parliament.
            </li>

            <li> Quartering Act: Colonists were required to
                house and supply British soldiers, which was seen as an infringement on t
                heir rights and privacy.</li>

            <li>
                Lack of self-governance: The British government
                frequently disregarded the colonies' ability to govern themselves,
                imposing restrictions on local </li>

            <li>Intolerable Acts**: After the Boston Tea Party,
                Britain passed these acts, which closed Bostonâ€™s port and
                limited colonial political power, increasing resentment. </li>

            <li> Overreach of British control: The King and
                Parliament increasingly interfered with colonial affairs,
                pushing many to seek independence as their only solution.
